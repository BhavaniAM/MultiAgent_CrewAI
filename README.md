## Employing multiagents to collaborate, pose, discuss and answer questions

# What is an *Agent*?
Large language models are driven by conversation. Such an interaction is typically between a human and an LLM. In cases where we cannot have a human conversing with an agent to obtain responses to questions, we desire that the LLM operate autonomously and insert and answer questions by itself.
An LLM that can operate without constant user input, can use tools (calling an API, posting content, gathering datapoints etc) and can optionally manage other LLMs is known as an agent. A group of such agents that are self-sufficicent without constant supervision are known as multiagents.
